Pesquisa relacionada ao seminário da cadeira de Sistemas Inteligentes sobre Sistemas Multiagentes.

## O que é?

Sistemas Multiagentes (SMA) são sistemas computacionais compostos de dois ou mais agentes inteligentes que interagem entre si, sendo capazes de perceber e agir em seus respectivos ambientes. São utilidos para resolução de problemas complexos que requerem a coordenação entre multiplos agentes ou componentes.

## Como surgiu e em que contexto histórico?

![alt História da Inteligência Artificial](https://bioinfo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/word-image-20.png "História da Inteligência Artificial")

O surgimento de Sistemas Multiagentes aconteceu nas décadas de 1980 e 1990, após o primeiro inverno da IA e juntamente ao crescimento nas pesquisas dos Sistemas Especialistas. 

Vale destacar também os avanços do desenvolvimento do Hardware da época e o surgimento da internet ([ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET)) iniciaram-se as pesquisas na área de computação distribuida

Os principais trabalhos da época tinham como motivação superar as limitações dos modelos tradicionais centralizados de inteligência artificial, onde um único agente era responsável pela tomadas de decisão e ações.  

## Historical Context

The development of multi-agent systems can be traced back to the early 1960s, with the work of researchers in artificial intelligence, computer science, and control theory. Over the years, multi-agent systems have evolved to encompass a wide range of theories, models, and algorithms for the design and implementation of multi-agent systems.

## Purpose of Multi-Agent Systems

The purpose of multi-agent systems is to provide a computational framework for solving problems that require coordination between multiple agents or components. They can be used to model complex systems, such as social, economic, or ecological systems, that involve multiple agents with different goals and perspectives.

## When to Use Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems should be used when the problem at hand requires coordination between multiple agents or components, and when other AI techniques are not well-suited to the task. They are particularly useful in problems that involve agents with conflicting goals, where coordination and communication are needed to reach a solution.

## How Multi-Agent Systems Work

Multi-agent systems work by allowing individual agents to perceive and act in their environment, and to communicate and coordinate with other agents in order to solve problems. The coordination and communication between agents is achieved through the use of protocols, languages, and algorithms for communication, negotiation, and decision making.
## Examples of Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems have been used in a wide range of practical fields, including:

    Robotics
    Supply Chain Management
    Traffic Control
    Environmental Monitoring
    Disaster Response
    Artificial Markets

## Frameworks for Multi-Agent Systems Implementation

There are several frameworks available for the implementation of multi-agent systems, including:

    MASON (Multi-Agent Simulator of Networks)
    JaCaMo (Java-based Framework for Multi-Agent Systems)
    MADKIT (Multi-Agent Development Kit)
    Jason (Java-based interpreter for AgentSpeak)

## Similar AI Techniques to Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems are similar to other AI techniques, including:

    Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)
    Swarm Intelligence
    Game Theory

## Differences between Multi-Agent Systems and Similar AI Techniques

Multi-agent systems differ from other AI techniques in terms of their focus on coordination and communication between agents, as well as their ability to model complex systems that involve multiple agents with different goals and perspectives.

## Advantages of Multi-Agent Systems

There are several advantages of using multi-agent systems, including:

    Scalability
    Flexibility
    Decentralization
    Coordination
    Modeling Complex Systems
    Robustness
    Decentralized Learning

## Drawbacks of Multi-Agent Systems

There are also some drawbacks of multi-agent systems, including:

    Complexity
    Interaction Overhead
    Difficulty in Modeling
    Difficulty in Verification and Validation
    Lack of Standards
    Limited Theoretical Foundation
    Difficulty in Scaling

Overall, multi-agent systems offer several advantages and disadvantages compared to other AI techniques, and their use should be carefully considered based on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.
